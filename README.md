# ðŸŒ€ CZ: C Lang but Make It Gen Z

> ðŸš€ A chaotic fusion of C programming and Gen Z lingo, brought to life with ANTLR. Itâ€™s giving programming vibes.

## ðŸ‘€ What Even Is CZ?

CZ (C-Zee or C-Zed, idk and idc) is a *spicy remix* of the C programming language that speaks your language â€” like literally. Think `yeet` instead of `return`, `vibing` instead of `for`, etc.

## Rebuilt using:
- ðŸ§¬ ANTLR â€“ for turning slang into syntax trees.
- â˜• Java â€“ because we like our compilers strong and portable.**
