# 🌀 CZ: C Lang but Make It Gen Z

> 🚀 A chaotic fusion of C programming and Gen Z lingo, brought to life with ANTLR. It’s giving programming vibes.

## 👀 What Even Is CZ?

CZ (C-Zee or C-Zed, idk and idc) is a *spicy remix* of the C programming language that speaks your language — like literally. Think `bounce` instead of `return`, `vibing` instead of `for`, etc. It's for those who want to flex their code with style, while also *having fun*.

### 🏅 Features of CZ:
- **Gen Z Syntax**: Replaces traditional C keywords with some *lit* alternatives, e.g.,:
    - `bounce` instead of `return`
    - `vibing` instead of `for`
    - `g` instead of `double`
    - `fr` instead of `if`
    - `squad` instead of `array` (you get it, right?)
- **Built-in Gen Z Standard Library**: A set of "built-in" functions designed to work with arrays and bring some flavor into your life. You can now do things like:
    - `array_length` (Get the length of an array, duh!)
    - `array_at` (Get an element at a specific index — called "squad_peep" in CZ)
    - `sine` (Get the sine value of a number 👀)
    - and more!

- **Mixes Modern Syntax with Classic C**: While you’re using slang, you still get all the power and structure of C! You can define functions, work with variables, and even use loops — all with *spicy* names.
- **Strong Typing**: CZ still honors C’s static typing, so don’t worry about being all loosey-goosey with your variable types. We like to keep it strong and reliable. You’re gonna love it!
